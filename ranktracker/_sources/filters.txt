Ranktracker Results Filters
===========================

The filters feature gives you the tools to create customized "views"
of your results. If you have a lot of pairs in the results view it can
become cumbersome/annoying to look for a specific pair or group of
pairs; filters let you define named views of your data that will
filter out pairs based on the criteria you've configured.

You can also set a default filter so that when you first visit the
results page that filter will be applied (you can do this by clicking
on the "Settings" button).

When creating a filter, the URL or Keyword column criteria will match
over all the URL's - so if you enter "blog" in the URL column any pair
with a URL that has the word "blog" in it will be matched. If you want
to filter by a specific domain, you should put the domain in the URL
field and any pair's URL that has that domain in it will be
filtered. The same applied to the keyword column.
