Generating Reports
==================

The PDF reports feature generates a PDF based on the current filter
view - if a filter has been selected and then you click on "PDF" it
will produce a PDF of the same exact view you are looking at. If you
want all of them you must select "Default" from the filter list, or
for any of the other filters.

This allows you to create PDF reports based on specific filter
criteria - if you want to only show a specific group of domains, for
example.

If you wish to have your own logo inserted into the PDF when it's
generated - you can click on the "Settings" button and at the bottom
of the page you will see "PDF White Labeling"; you can upload your own
logo (once uploaded it will provide a preview of the logo).

We are working on being able to pick and choose, sort, and mash your
data in more meaningful ways for the reports.
