Settings for the Ranktracker
============================

The Ranktracker settings can be found by clicking on the "Settings"
button.

Email Frequency
---------------

This setting refers to how often Whoosh Traffic! will email you your
ranktracker results. The default is "daily" but you can select
anything from weekly to nothing at all.

Domain Scan
-----------

This setting controls whether the ranktracker will scan your newly
inserted pairs and perform the weekly scan on all of your pairs to
find deep links in the SERPs. If you do not want any URL/keyword pairs
being added to your account automatically, then this setting should be
**unchecked** - otherwise the default is **ON**.

Removed Scan
------------

.. note::
   If the above setting (**Domain Scan**) is unchecked, this setting (checked or not) will have absolutely no effect.

.. warning::
   This setting can potentially make your results page very cluttered with unwanted results if you do not know precisely what you are doing with it!

This setting controls whether we re-add pairs you've already deleted
that have been found by the scanner. Let's say that you add some new
pairs and our scanner finds 100 new deeplinks for you. These added
pairs pollute your results so you delete them and we never add those
again when the scanner runs. But say two months later you do want
those deeplinks added to your results page - if you want previously
deleted pairs to be re-added by the weekly scanner then this setting
must be checked!

Filter Management
-----------------

You can manage all of the filters you've created. You can set which
one you want to be the default, edit them, and removed them.

PDF White Labeling
------------------

This gives you the ability to upload/change your company's logo that
will be inserted into the PDF reports.
